SUBJECT: test from C.Artho'04, fig 6



DOCUMENTED ANOMALIES: this was also created as an example of a correct program
take will raise an anomaly. it would be RwW, however it is a false positive since
user ensures he can write. points-to would be needed to avoid this. paper says
it would require model-checking, I dont know



EXPECTED RESULTS: only this false RwW should be flagged. if it is the only false positive,
this is acceptable.



RESULTS:
another false positive than expected! but this is because of subfields, maybe we
should change rules for accesses.

IDEA:

this.field.subfield.subsub should count as a single read? this might bring problems...
