SUBJECT: java.lang.StringBuffer example from Flanagan+Freund '04



DOCUMENTED ANOMALIES: on append(), we read size of other buffer, then use it to
create array of correct size. other buffer could have changed meanwhile.



EXPECTED RESULTS: nothing! both atoms are readers. this is actually a very
tricky case. ideally it should be RwW, but we would have to know what happens
inside length() and getChars(..). then again, if we disregard both methods as R+W,
we would have RwR + WrW



RESULTS:
nothing to say.
